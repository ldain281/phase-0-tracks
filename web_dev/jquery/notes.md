jquery learning plan:

Google jQuery resources:
	how and why it's used - record good refs
https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery
Quentin Watt Tutorials on youtube

	basic tutorials
	syntax reference pages
	how-to videos

Read/watch
	take notes
	bookmarking helpful references
	practice snippets where possible

Take short 5 min breaks after ~30 min., after review what was learned before break

Stratedgies that were most effective:
1. learn what is jQuery
2. view how it is written
3. download and setup
4. taking a longer break than planned, which was effective. 
5. follow-along with some videos
6. experiment on my own
