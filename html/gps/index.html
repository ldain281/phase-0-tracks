<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The semantic tags provide meaning for the browser for how to understand the information, how it is organized, and allows for accessability. I find the article and section tags very useful as it allows us to mentally divide the page up into its different sections later on, especially when applying CSS.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
For HTML, the browser will render it from top to bottom.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Creating snippets! Definitely when I'm working with more languages, it'll be helpful to preload and automate basic structuring for my documents like HTML.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
These addition semantic tags, knowing when to use a header versus an H1 tag, and how to think through the use of sections in pair with CSS.
