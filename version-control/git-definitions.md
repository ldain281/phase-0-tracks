* What is version control? [LD]Version control stores every version of a committed updated file along with the metadata associated with the file.  Why is it useful? [LD]It is useful because it allows for roll-back, records who did what work and allows access to all versions.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? [LD]A branch is a copy of the code base. Here I can work on a feature concurrently with other developers working on the same or other features and then roll my changes back to the main code line.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? [LD]A commit is a check-in of my changes back into the branch. A good commit message describes what changes I made, and if appropriate, why.
* What is a merge conflict? [LD]A merge conflict is a version control conflict when two or more of the same file (name and path) in different branches will be merged
